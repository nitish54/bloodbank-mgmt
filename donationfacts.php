              to save precious life. Blood has always been the most crucial component of life. But we have failed to 
              realize its actual importance. Blood plays a life saver in our worst time but we run short of it in the high time of need. As there is no
              substitute for blood, blood donation is the only option to meet the requirements. However, there is still some
              distrust among people regarding blood donation. Donating blood is safe and easy. A person can donate blood after 
              every three months as body recovers blood very quickly. Blood donation is needed more than ever. No matter who you
              are and where you are, by donating blood you can save and contribute to life. </p></div></td>
